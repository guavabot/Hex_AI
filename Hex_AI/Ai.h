/*
 This class returns computer generated Moves
 It simulates the moves that the computer's opponent can make in response
 to every possible computer movement.
 It estimates results by running a Monte Carlo simulation of 1000 outcomes.
 
 Hence for n free positions,
 there are (n)(n-1)(1000) outcomes simulated
 
 To reduce the number of simulations two things are done:
 1. (Alphaâ€“beta pruning) For each of the computer possible moves, if an opponent
 move is found that is better for him than his current best move, simulations
 for that computer possible move are stopped.
 2. Only positions that have at least one occupied position in the neighbors of 
 its neighbors are considered. The center of the board is always considered.
